# GSL1680 Arduino driver

**This project is not in active development since I don't have the hardware anymore, but if a bug is found, please consider opening an issue or a pull request**

pin | function  | Arduino Uno
----|-----------|------------
1   | SCL       | A5
2   | SDA       | A4
3   | VDD (3v3) | 3v3
4   | Wake      | 4
5   | Int       | 2
6   | Gnd       | GND

Warning : Firmware is really heavy so this library cannot be used in some Arduino boards

[Tested with ESP32 DEV KIT V1]
