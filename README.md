# GSL1680 Arduino driver

**This project is not in active development since I don't have the hardware anymore, but if a bug is found, please consider opening an issue or a pull request**

pin | function  | Arduino Uno
----|-----------|------------
1   | SCL       | A5
2   | SDA       | A4

Warning : Firmware is really heavy so this library cannot be used in some Arduino boards
